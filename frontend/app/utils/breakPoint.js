 * There are several configuration controls :
 * . the 'debugger' statement can be disabled by clearing breakInDebugger
 * . breaking is enabled while breakPointEnable is > 0, it decrements with each break.
 * . the arguments will be logged to console if breakPoint_trace > 1,
 *   and also while breakPointEnable > 0.
